# FoundationApplication
This is intended to be an Application Foundation that will allow developers to focus on building Business Functionality into an Enterprise Application rather than dealing with Authentication, Roles and Permissions.  This is not intended for small SPA application but rather the ability to create multiple SPA application or forms that fit into a standard framework utilizing well known technologies.  The initial stack is MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node).  This frame strives not to limit the developers from choosing other storage and UI technologies for individual SPA applications. However the core Foundation modules (fndtn) should consistently use the MERN stack.
